  1. Lightweight: don't need much memory of computer and relatively simple syntax and features.
  2. Cross-platform : Language can be use on multiple platform and systems not just for web development.
  3. Object-oriented : Language based on objects.

- Today, JavaScript can be used in different place:

  1. client-side: JavaScript was traditionally only used in the browser.
  2. server-side: By node.js we can use JavaScript on the server side as well.

  1. Dynamic effect and interactive.
  2. Modern web-application that we can interact with

  - HTML responsible for the content of the page.

    1. text,
    2. images,
    3. button etc..

    example: <p></p> this means "paragraph"

  - CSS responsible for the presentation of the page.
    styling
