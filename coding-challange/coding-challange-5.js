/********************************
 * CODING CHALLENGE - 5
 */

/*
Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advance version
using everything we learned!

This, time John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The bills
were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less then $50, 15% when
the bill is between $50 to $20.
Implement s tip calculator using object and loops:
1). Create an object with an array for the bill values.
2). Add a method to calculate the tip.
3). This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills
and do the tip calculation...
4). As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and 2) an 
array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip). HINT: Start with two
empty arrays [] as properties and them fill them up in the loop.

EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 
four different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110 and $45.
Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10%
when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than 
$300(different than John).

5). Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's
tipping rule.
6). Create a function(not a method) to calculate the average of a given
array of tips. HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the
current sum in the variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of 
the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you
calculate the average.)
7). Calculate the average tip for each family.
8). Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average

GOOD LUCKðŸ˜€
